# Healthcare Data Analysis & Insights

## ❓ Problem Statement
The objective of this project is to analyze healthcare data to extract actionable insights that could help improve patient care and healthcare resource management. By working with multiple datasets, Advanced Excel techniques were utilized to clean, transform, and analyze the data to uncover meaningful patterns.

## 📊 Data Understanding
The dataset includes the following key attributes:
- **Patient Health Profile**: BMI, Blood Sugar Levels, Smoking Status
- **Medical History**: Heart Issues, Transplants, Cancer History, Number of Major Surgeries
- **Healthcare Costs**: Hospital Charges, Hospital Tier, City Tier
- **Demographics**: Age, State ID

## ⚙️ Technology Stack
- **Excel (Advanced Features)**: Data Cleaning, Transformation, Pivot Tables
- **ETL Process in Excel**: Data preprocessing using formulas and functions
- **Pivot Tables:** Data aggregation and summarization
- **Data Visualization:** Charts, slicers, and dashboards

## 🏗️ Methodology
1. **Data Cleaning & Preparation**
   - Handled missing values using mean, median, and mode.
   - Standardized data format.
   - Removed duplicates and unnecessary columns.
   - Categorized BMI into Underweight, Healthy, Overweight, and Obese.
   - Classified blood sugar levels as Normal, Pre-Diabetic, and Diabetic.
   
2. **Data Aggregation & Transformation**
   - Segmented patient data based on BMI and Blood Sugar levels.
   - Used conditional formulas (`IF`, `VLOOKUP`, `COUNTIF`) for categorization.
   - Created Pivot Tables to generate key insights.

3. **Data Analysis & Insights**
   - **Smoking and Cancer Risk:** A **Donut Chart** revealed that non-smokers had a higher cancer history, suggesting that other factors contribute to cancer risk.
   - **Obesity & Cancer Correlation:** Overweight and obese patients showed a higher incidence of cancer.
   - **Diabetes & Surgeries:** Patients with uncontrolled blood sugar levels underwent more surgeries.
   - **Obesity & Hospital Costs:** Obese patients incurred higher hospital charges, even with normal blood sugar levels.
   - **Hospital Charge Trends:**
     - **Column Chart:** Tier 2 hospitals had the highest charges, potentially due to limited healthcare infrastructure.
     - **Line Chart:** Hospital charges increased with age, with a sharp rise after 60.
   - **Age, BMI, and Blood Sugar Trends:**
     - BMI and blood sugar levels increased with age.
     - After 60, BMI declined, while blood sugar spiked.
     - Unexpected high obesity rates among younger patients (25-35 years).

4. **Dashboard Creation**
   - Designed an **interactive Excel dashboard**.
   - Used dynamic charts and slicers for filtering insights.
   - Visualized trends in BMI, Blood Sugar, and Hospital Charges.

## 📈 Key Insights Generated
### 🔹 Patient Health Trends
- Obesity is a major contributor to high healthcare costs.
- Young patients (25-35) showing obesity is a concerning trend.
- Diabetes is strongly linked to multiple surgeries and hospitalizations.

### 🔹 Hospital & Cost Analysis
- Tier 2 hospitals charge more, possibly due to lack of awareness and infrastructure.
- Healthcare costs rise significantly after 60 due to age-related factors.

## 📊 Business Impact & Benefits
✅ **Preventive Healthcare Strategies**: Identifying high-risk patients for early intervention.
✅ **Cost Optimization**: Understanding key cost drivers to reduce hospital expenses.
✅ **Resource Allocation**: Data-driven decisions for hospital resource planning.
✅ **Public Health Awareness**: Encouraging healthier lifestyles to reduce long-term healthcare costs.

## 🚀 Getting Started
1. Download the dataset and open in Excel.
2. Follow the data cleaning and transformation steps.
3. Use Pivot Tables to analyze key metrics.
4. Build the dashboard using slicers and charts.
